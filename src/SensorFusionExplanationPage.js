        Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from different sensors to produce a more accurate and reliable estimate of a physical quantity. In this context, the M5StickC Plus uses sensor fusion to combine data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to calculate pitch, roll, and yaw.

Pitch, roll, and yaw are the angles that describe the orientation of an object relative to a fixed reference frame. Pitch is the angle between the X-axis of the object and the horizontal plane, roll is the angle between the Y-axis of the object and the horizontal plane, and yaw is the angle between the X-axis of the object and the north direction.

The accelerometer measures linear acceleration along each axis of the object, while the gyroscope measures angular velocity around each axis of the object. However, both sensors have limitations and sources of error that affect their accuracy.

The accelerometer can measure the direction of gravity when the object is stationary or moving at a constant velocity. This can be used to determine pitch and roll angles by using trigonometric functions. However, when the object is accelerating or decelerating, the accelerometer also measures the acceleration due to motion, which introduces errors in pitch and roll estimation. Moreover, the accelerometer cannot measure yaw angle at all.

The gyroscope can measure angular velocity around each axis of the object, which can be integrated over time to obtain angular displacement or orientation. This can be used to estimate pitch, roll, and yaw angles by using Euler angles or quaternions. However, the gyroscope suffers from drift over time due to noise and bias in the sensor readings. This causes errors in orientation estimation that accumulate over time.

To overcome these limitations and errors, sensor fusion algorithms are used to combine the data from both sensors and produce a more accurate and reliable estimate of orientation. A common method of sensor fusion used for this purpose is the Kalman filter or complementary filter1.

The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that uses a mathematical model of the system dynamics and sensor measurements to estimate the state of a system. The state can include position, velocity, orientation, etc. The Kalman filter consists of two steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the filter uses the previous state estimate and the system model to predict the current state estimate. In the update step, the filter uses the sensor measurements and their uncertainties to correct or update the predicted state estimate.

The complementary filter is a simpler algorithm that uses a weighted average of two sensor measurements to estimate a physical quantity. The complementary filter consists of two components: a high-pass filter and a low-pass filter. The high-pass filter passes high-frequency signals and attenuates low-frequency signals, while the low-pass filter does the opposite. The complementary filter applies a high-pass filter to one sensor measurement and a low-pass filter to another sensor measurement, and then adds them together to obtain an estimate.

In this context, a common way to use sensor fusion with a Kalman filter or complementary filter is to use accelerometer data as a low-pass filter for pitch and roll angles, and gyroscope data as a high-pass filter for pitch, roll, and yaw angles. The accelerometer data provides accurate information about pitch and roll angles when there is no linear acceleration, but it is noisy at high frequencies. The gyroscope data provides accurate information about angular velocity at high frequencies, but it drifts at low frequencies. By combining them with appropriate weights or gains, a more accurate and reliable estimate of orientation can be obtained.

Sensor fusion has many advantages and applications in motion tracking and orientation estimation. It can improve accuracy, reliability, robustness, and resolution of sensor measurements. It can also reduce noise, drift, latency, and computational complexity of sensor processing. Sensor fusion can be used for various purposes such as navigation, gesture recognition, virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming, robotics, etc.
